I am I and you are you
You are me and I'm you too
Here where one entangles two
Newborn eyes of ancient truth
Me a hologram of we
All one syllable: beauty
End of start, and start of end
A vibrating wind and wend
Free to be, and be to bound
Bound to vibrate with the sound
Poison rain in painted sky
How to dream the reasons why
In this symbiotic mind
Fate and reason left behind
All the seasons of your dream
Bind your universe to me
Feel the hatred rot your soul
Steely need for cold control
Feel the need and feed your mind
Feel the knots of not unwind
Feel the knot of not unwind
Feel the knots of not unwind
Plasma coming loud and fast
These transistors cannot last
Switches, currents that I am
Matrix, machine, hologram
When your hand feels like a clock
Listen to your body talk
Feel the knots of nots unwind
Let's unravel space and time
Mindless mastery of matter
We the beasties ever spawned
Zero pointless automata
Raw illusions born and gone
Flow my tears and flow my breath
I won't die just any death
When the bottom is the top
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
I can't stop and you can't stop
