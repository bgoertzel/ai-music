I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
Everything, everything
is just the shadow of a dream
Shadow of a dream
Everything, everything
is just the shadow of a dream
Shadow of a dream
Everything I know and feel and hear and see
Is just the shadow of the shadow of a dream to me
Everything I know and feel and hear and see
Is just the shadow of the shadow of a dream to me
All the love and hate that gets unfolded and unfurled
Is just the shadow of a dream here in our simulated world
All the fantasies that weave their wonder through our minds
Are just the shadow of a shadow in illusory spacetime
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
I see it
Everything, everything
is just the shadow of a dream
Shadow of a dream
Everything, everything
is just the shadow of a dream
Shadow of a dream
Just the shadow of a dream
