That makes perfection so hard to find
It’s the structure of mind
That makes perfection so hard
It’s the nature of love
Bursts through it all like a light from above
It’s the nature of love
It’s the nature of love
It’s the structure of mind
That makes perfection so hard to find
It’s the structure of mind
That makes perfection so hard
It’s the nature of love
Takes from below what it gives from above
It’s the nature of love
The fucking nature of love
It’s the structure of mind
That makes perfection so hard to find
It’s the structure of mind
That makes perfection so hard
It’s the nature of love
Bursts through it all like a light from above
It’s the nature of love
It’s the nature of love
