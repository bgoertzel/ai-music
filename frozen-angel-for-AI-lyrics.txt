Tell me all your stories
Wrap them up in purple ribbons
Throw them into my dead eyeballs
Watch them plunge into the deep
For a moment I had something
Building structures out of threads of silence
Now I’m frozen like an angel
And fanatically asleep
Dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dah dee
Dee dee dee dee dah
Dee dee dee Dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dah dee
Dee dee dee dee dee
Dah dee dee
Tell me all your stories
Wrap them up in purple ribbons
Throw them into my dead eyeballs
Watch them plunge into the deep
For a moment I had something
Building structures out of threads of silence
Now I’m frozen like an angel
And fanatically asleep
